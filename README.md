## Project Overview
Nightmare-Manor is a Halloween-themed interactive website designed to immerse visitors in a spooky haunted house experience. This project marks the first individual web development project for Code Institute, showcasing the application of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in creating an engaging, themed website.

**Visitors can explore:**

A Home/Landing page with a striking hero image and call-to-action to book a visit.
An Experience section highlighting haunted rooms and characters.
A Booking Form to schedule their visit.
A “Your Fate Is Sealed” page with animated effects for a memorable confirmation.

The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts, with fonts from Google Fonts and thematic visuals sourced from Canva, Unsplash, and Gemini. Accessibility and visual consistency were prioritized through a carefully curated color palette and contrast-checked design.

This project serves both as a creative web development exercise and a demonstration of building immersive, interactive web experiences as part of the Code Institute curriculum.<br>
